Description: Development utilities for the GLib library
 GLib is a library containing many useful C routines for things such
 as trees, hashes, lists, and strings.  It is a useful general-purpose
 C library used by projects such as GTK+, GIMP, and GNOME.
 .
 This package is needed to compile programs against libglib2.0-0. It contains
 development utilities typically run during compilation and should not be
 installed directly. Use libglib2.0-dev instead.
